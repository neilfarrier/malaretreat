                        Adrian and Christine's place is very quiet and peaceful, being a few km out of East Maitland. It
                        was sparkling clean and tidy with lots of thoughtful touches and extras. I particularly
                        appreciated the nice bottle of red, the most comfortable bed, and the OJ and breakfast cereal.
                        Thanks guys.

An absolutely perfect stay for a travelling guest/s. Adrian is prompt you respond and is very considerate and caring. I would absolutely recommend.                    </p>

                        This is a terrific place to stop over in Maitland or use as a base to explore the Hunter Valley. It is both very comfortable and spotlessly clean. Wonderful cheese and wine was provided by a thoughtful host. It is also sensibly priced. We loved it because we were able to rest here after a long drive from Queensland.                    </p>

                        This studio was such a great find. It was in a great location and such a beautiful new room. Adrian and Christine were so kind and helpful giving us plenty of tips on where to go and best kept secrets in the area. Definitely will be returning in the future!
